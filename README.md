# Aggregate

A collection of various small additions and changes bundled into one mod. Most can be individually enabled, disabled or configured.

## Contents

- Features controlled by via mod config menu:
  - Added stone javelins. Similar to tridents, but stackable, weaker, and easily craftable.
  - Large animals drop bones.
  - New crafting recipes for arrows, substituting flint for stone or bones.
  - All items are immune to fire, lava and explosions.
  - Players and mobs have a couple seconds before they start suffocating inside blocks.
  - Fire does not destroy blocks and does not spread.
  - Sugar cane can be planted on mud. Planting it on mud doesn't require water.
  - Mud blocks slow down movement.
  - Creeper explosions don't damage blocks.
  - Frogs have random colours.
  - Bone meal can be used on mud.
  - Leather can be crafted from wool.
  - Sub-diamond tools improved.
  - Sub-diamond armour improved.
  - Disabled escalating level cost penalty for repeated item repairs at anvil.
  - Armour weight system - players whose armour weight points cross a threshold are marked as heavy. (chest/legs = 4, boots/helmet = 2, leather = 0).
  - Weak blocks (ice, magma, lilypad, mud, moss carpet, sand, gravel) cannot support players wearing heavy armour and will fail in different ways.
  - Improved player movement physics. Player air drag and air control greatly reduced. Jumping preserves current speed.
  - Players don't sink in water.
  - Ice and magma blocks break when a player falls on them from more than 2 blocks height.

  - Players and mobs are not knocked away by normal attacks.
  - TNT is stronger.
  - Player movement speed and sprint speed can be adjusted.
  - Disallow replacing water or lava with blocks. Can be toggled for water, lava, source and flowing blocks separately. Option to prevent pouring a fluid bucket into a source block of the same fluid also included.

## Known Issues and notes
- Built-in datapacks don't get baked into saves, so keep it in mind when updating the mod or transferring saves.
- The diagonal climbing option makes climbing more reliable, but it is slightly exploitable.
- The datapack features may overwrite biome changes made by other mods. Better compatibility is being worked on.
